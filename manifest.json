This retro style racing game is about navigating a randomly generated 3D city in your 1986 Toyota Corolla, while listening to hand-coded floatbeat music and sound effects. Another highlight is the custom 3D rendering engine implemented in JavaScript (that might not work on slower machines, sorry).",
